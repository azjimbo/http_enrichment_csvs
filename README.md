I found that I wanted to start to block folks probing my web server and not looking for the awesome content.  

These files are now used in that process.  I went looking for existing csv files to download, but couldn't find anything - so I made my own.

Using my home lab Splunk, I already had a rule that too many 404s would get blocked, but these files help extend the preventive logic.  

By including the description fields, it allows me to quickly understand exactly what is being attempted.  

My personal web servers are farily simple, and don't get much traffic.  So sifting through these results is completely manageable.  

If you have a use case for these, enjoy.
